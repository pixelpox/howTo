# issues

I get the following error

```
extfsclone.c: bitmap free count err, partclone get free:482036 but extfs get 502666

check /var/log/partcone.log
```
# How to fix

run clonezilla again and when asked about checking the filesystem select to preform a system check on the source drive before clonging (milldle option)

# source
